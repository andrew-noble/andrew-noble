Hey! I'm Andrew. I am a generalist technologist. Studied hardware formally, but also love to code. You'll find a growing list of public repos here. Mostly web development but some embedded and ml projects hiding in here too. 

You might be here as a potential employer or collaborator, in which case here are my most recent and impressive projects:

- Physics Viewer: AI-powered tool for learning introductory physics. [loom demo](https://www.loom.com/share/5bb747b3ffae4accb7b91c44520d1966?sid=8a8b57cc-e71e-4e7e-806a-733e27ef9ad6) | [live app](https://physicsviewer.com)
- Circuit Tutor: similar to above but for circuits. [loom demo](https://www.loom.com/share/535632b1f0874b6787f7bca180ea5564?sid=0746db11-bc07-49a9-9d00-b5fdacfd901b) | [live app](https://circuit-tutor.xyz)
- Fermi-game: a game for learning how to make estimates quickly. It got 3k views on Hacker News. [loom demo](https://www.loom.com/share/3ddcf479a4ab407bbf1ce1bca7bdf5d2?sid=888b39d4-d76b-42e4-b9df-c7b626cb4d09) | [live app](https://fermi-game.onrender.com/)
